= Postgres 11 with reduced writes I/O setup

== Purpose

Performance optimization for cases such as unit-tests; has a similar effect as an in-memory db.

== Changes to default config

/var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf

    fsync=off
    synchronous_commit=off
    full_page_writes=off
    bgwriter_lru_maxpages=0


    port=15432

Note: To provide a default postgresql.conf, the PGDATA location must be different from the config location,
otherwise initdb will complain about a non-empty directory. E.g. PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata

== Build

docker build -t postgres_nofsync .
