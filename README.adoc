= Postgres 11 with reduced writes I/O setup

== Purpose

Performance optimization for cases such as unit-tests; has a similar effect as an in-memory db.

== New default config

The image provides a new default postgresql.conf that needs to be copied to the actual postgresql.conf after initdb, like:

    cp /var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata/postgresql.conf

The changes in this file are:

    fsync=off
    synchronous_commit=off
    full_page_writes=off
    bgwriter_lru_maxpages=0


    port=15432

Note: For this to work the PGDATA location must be different from the config location,
otherwise initdb will complain about a non-empty directory. E.g. PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata

== Build

docker build -t local/postgres_nofsync .
